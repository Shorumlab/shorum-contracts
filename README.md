The environment is built using Docker Compose, note that your `.env` file must have the RPC URL of the network you want to use, and an optional `MNEMONIC` and `BLOCK_EXPLORER_KEY`, defined like so, assuming you choose to use Mumbai network:

```
MNEMONIC="MNEMONIC YOU WANT TO DERIVE WALLETS FROM HERE"
MUMBAI_RPC_URL="YOUR RPC URL HERE"
BLOCK_EXPLORER_KEY="YOUR BLOCK EXPLORER API KEY HERE"
```
